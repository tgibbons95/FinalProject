Connect 4 Program-How to Use

NOTE: I commented out Lines 6, 7, and second line of displayBoard.
	Those lines of code are system dependent and did not know what
	you would be compiling the program on. We compiled on windows, but
	for linux simply change cls to clear in line 7. It works just as well
	but we figured we would get rid of prior boards. 

You will be given option of 1 to 2 players

Checks for four in a row across, down, and diagonally.
Checks if whole board is full. Based on if each column is full.
It ends the game when one of the prior statements is true.

Game itself is very solid but have not incorporated all of the features yet.
