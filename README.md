Errors and dependencies
        Included one line system("cls") which is windows exclusive
    but we could easily change it to "clear" before compiling on linux
    it is system dependent but makes for a better display while testing.
        All the classes currently have everything public as I couldn't 
    figure out the friend class setup.
Still needs to get done:
    create option for 1 or 2 player
    create option for color preference
    create main menu
    create save game option
    create load game option
    create how to play option
    create AI with random move
if we want to    
    hardware component
    our own AI for difficulty change
