Errors and dependencies
    All the classes currently have everything public as we couldn't 
    figure out the friend class setup.
	
Still needs to get done:
    create option for 1 or 2 player
    create option for color preference
    create main menu
    create save game option
    create load game option
    create how to play option
    create AI with random move
	
Extra TODO:    
    hardware component
    our own AI for difficulty change
