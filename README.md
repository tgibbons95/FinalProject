Edited: 11-23-16 6:00 PM

Errors and dependencies:
	
	All the classes currently have everything public as we couldn't figure out the friend class setup.
	
Still needs to get done:
	
	create option for 1 or 2 player
	create option for color preference
	create main menu
	create save game option
	create load game option
	create how to play option
	create AI with random move
	
Extra TODO

	
	Hardware component
	Our own AI for difficulty changing
